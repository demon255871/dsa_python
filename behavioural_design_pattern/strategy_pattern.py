"""
The Strategy Pattern is a behavioral design pattern that defines a family of algorithms (strategies), encapsulates each one, and makes them interchangeable. The strategy pattern allows the algorithm to vary independently from the clients that use it. It enables selecting an algorithm at runtime.
Example: Payment Processing System

Let's say you are building a payment processing system, and the user can pay using different payment methods (credit card, PayPal, or cryptocurrency). You want to allow the payment method to be chosen dynamically at runtime without modifying the core logic.

Explanation:

    PaymentStrategy (Interface):
        This is the abstract base class for all payment strategies. It defines a single method pay() which takes the amount as an argument. Any concrete strategy must implement this method.

    Concrete Strategies:
        CreditCardPayment: Implements the payment logic for credit cards. It requires the card number and holderâ€™s name.
        PayPalPayment: Implements payment logic for PayPal. It requires the user's email.
        CryptoPayment: Implements payment logic for cryptocurrency. It requires the wallet address.

    PaymentProcessor (Context):
        This is the context class that interacts with the selected strategy. It holds a reference to a PaymentStrategy object and delegates the process_payment() call to the selected strategy's pay() method.
        The strategy can be dynamically changed at runtime using set_strategy().

    Client Code:
        The client chooses a payment method (strategy) at runtime, starting with credit card, then switching to PayPal, and finally using cryptocurrency.
