"""
The State Pattern is a behavioral design pattern that allows an object to alter its behavior when its internal state changes. It involves defining state-specific behavior within individual state classes, and the context (the object whose behavior changes) delegates state-specific behavior to these state classes.
Example: Vending Machine using the State Pattern

In this example, weâ€™ll implement a Vending Machine that can be in different states such as Idle, HasMoney, and SoldOut. The behavior of the vending machine will change depending on its current state. For instance, if the vending machine is in the SoldOut state, it won't accept money or dispense items.

Explanation:

    State Interface (VendingMachineState):
        The VendingMachineState is an abstract class that defines two methods: insert_money() and dispense(). These methods represent the actions that a vending machine can perform.

    Concrete States:
        IdleState: Represents the state where the vending machine is waiting for money to be inserted. If money is inserted, the machine transitions to the HasMoneyState.
        HasMoneyState: Represents the state where the vending machine has received money and is waiting to dispense the item. After dispensing, the machine either returns to IdleState or transitions to SoldOutState if there are no more items.
        SoldOutState: Represents the state where the vending machine has no items left to dispense. In this state, it will reject any money.

    Context (VendingMachine):
        The VendingMachine class represents the vending machine itself. It holds a reference to its current state and delegates the behavior to the current state's insert_money() and dispense() methods. It can transition between states by calling set_state().

    Client Code:
        The client code demonstrates the vending machine in action. Initially, the machine is in the IdleState. After inserting money, it moves to HasMoneyState and dispenses an item. Once the machine runs out of items, it transitions to SoldOutState and stops accepting money.
